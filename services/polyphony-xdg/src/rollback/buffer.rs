/// to the front of the queue and old blocks are truncated when the buffer grows
/// larger than MAX_BUFFER_LEN. When we process a new block (RollForward) we
/// push it to the front of the buffer, and when we process a RollBackwards(Point)

/// Some code is inspired by TxPipe's Pallas chainsync point rollback buffer,
/// but achieves different results. The Pallas chainsync rollback buffer pops
/// the _oldest_ points from the buffer once the buffer size reaches a
/// configurable size min-depth, where as this buffer is used to pop the most
/// recent blocks when a rollback instruction is received. Instead of storing
/// the block bytes, if the buffer is generic in the sense that it stores the
/// Point (block ID) along with some other information needed to undo the effects
/// of the block, for example consumed/produced UTxOs and storage actions.
